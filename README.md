# DKARST: modeling abrasional wear of scalloped bedrock in caves (note: this is developmental research grade software that has not been subject to review)
## Rachel Bosch and Dylan Ward

### Abstract
The extent to which chemical and mechanical erosion each contribute to the erosion of cave passages in limestone is an open question. In mixed cave riverbeds that are partially alluviated and partially exposed limestone bedrock, we sometimes see clearly scalloped bedrock. The uniquely soluble properties of limestone imply that these scallops that tessellate to comprise the scalloped bedrock are the result of chemical dissolution. However, because we see silt, sand, and gravel, and because when we visit the same reach of the cave river many times, we see those sediment deposits shift in size and location, we infer that there may also be physical abrasion from sediment impacts on the scalloped bedrock surface. Using our numerical model, DKARST (Does karst abrasion result in scalloped tunnels?), in conjunction with previous data from dissolution studies (Hammer et al., 2011; Grm et al., 2017), we tested the hypothesis that mechanical abrasion is a significant erosional process in the development and maintenance of scallops in limestone cave passages. Our investigation into the role of mechanical erosion in relation to the scalloping of bedrock in caves provides insight into the settling velocities of particles in turbulent flow over rough beds, as well as the relative roles played by mechanical and chemical processes in broader scale landscape evolution, particularly in karst regions dominated by carbonate bedrock.
