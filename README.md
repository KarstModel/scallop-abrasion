# DKARST: modeling abrasional wear of scalloped bedrock in caves
## Rachel Bosch and Dylan Ward

### Abstract
The extent to which chemical and mechanical erosion each contribute to the erosion of cave passages in limestone is an open question. In cave riverbeds that are mixed alluvial and bedrock, we sometimes see clearly scalloped bedrock. The uniquely soluble properties of limestone imply that these scallops are the result of chemical dissolution. However, because we see silt, sand, and gravel, and because when we visit the same reach of the river many times, we see those sediment deposits shift in size and location, we infer that there may also be physical abrasion from sediment impacts on the scalloped bedrock surface.  SimpleLaminarCFDAbrasion.py was used to compare the equations that describe dissolution of limestone with those that describe abrasion of bedrock. Using the full numerical model, DKARST (Does karst abrasion results in scalloped tunnels?), in conjunction with previous data from dissolution studies, we quantified parameters that delineate four distinct erosional regimes according to the likelihood of contribution to overall erosion from dissolution, abrasion, or both processes combined. Our investigation of the role of mechanical erosion to the scalloping of bedrock in caves provides insight into the relative roles played by mechanical and chemical processes in broader scale landscape evolution, particularly in karst regions dominated by carbonate bedrock.
